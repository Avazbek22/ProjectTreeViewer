# DevProjex 📁🌳

**Visual project context builder for humans and AI**

DevProjex is a cross-platform desktop application for **quickly exploring folder/project structures**, selecting what matters, and copying **clean, controlled context** (tree, file contents, or both) to the clipboard.

It’s designed for real projects where CLI output is noisy, IDE tools are unavailable or limited, and you need **clarity, speed, and control**.

> 🔒 Read-only by design — DevProjex never modifies your files.
